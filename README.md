# Atliq revenue and occupancy insights-2022.
This is a project exhibiting the revenue and occupancy rate of AtliQ hotels from May-July 2022.
The goal was to analyze AtliQ Hotels' occupancy and revnue for three months- May - July 2022. I made use of **Excel** for data cleaning and validation and **PowerBi** to visualize the datasets.
## Metadata.
AtliQ company is found in the hospitality domain existing for over 20 years with 25 hotels around India in 7 seven hotel categories namely **AtliQ Grands, AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ City,  AtliQ Blu, AtliQ Bay, AtliQ Palace, AtliQ Seasons**. Each of these have rooms in the Standard (RT1), Elite (RT2), Premium (RT3) and Presidential (RT4) Categories and are found in Bangladore, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. However, this business has been facing challenges with their market share and revenue and turned to Business and Data intelligence for proper analysis and data-guided decision making so as to improve market strategy.
## Objective
The goal was to analyze datasets and derive insights on Occupancy, revenue, average rating; generally market share performance and how shortcomings can be improved on.
## Data Cleaning and Validation.
Imported and cleaned datasets in the following ways using Excel:
1. rearranged columns and rows and handled missing values and ensured proper datatype for time series and monetary values.
2. clasified room id and room number using text-columns.
3. used conditional formating for proper data comprehension.
4. used pivot tables to calculate occupancy, profit, losses and seasonal revenue.
5. filtered each property/ city and category.
## Data Modeling
Structured data tables into charts for optimum analysis and performance measure. 
## Dashboard Design
 Created an filter-based interactive dashboard for visual exploration using **PowerBi** helping Managing Director and revenue team for view metrics from May-July and quickly grasp knowledge on occupancy and revenue.
 Built the following visuals for easy understanding of business trend:
 1. Funnel chart for daytype occupancy, revenue/hotel and count of bookers/booking platform.
 2. Guage for count of days.
 3. Clustered column and bar charts for for total revenue, count of guests/room category and revenue/ booking status (cancelled,checked out and no show).
 4. Multi row and matrix card showing hotel code and name and hotel category/city.
## Insights Extracted
 1. datasets presented had data for the property for 92 days.
 2. AtliQ's properties have 7 recognised booking platforms.
 3. As concerns booking status of hotels, the percentage of checked out guests surpassed all other statuses by 82% generating 1.4 billion USD, 12% cancellation and 6% no show.
 4. As concerns revenue generated in 92 days, AtliQ property generated over 1 billion USD with AtliQ Exotica having 4 luxury hotels across major cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad generating the most revenue of 320 million USD while AtliQ Seasons having one business class hotel in Mumbai generated the least revenue of 66 million USD.
 5. As concerns revenue generated/room category and number of guests/ room category, RT2 (Elite) generated over 560 million USD and had the highest number of guests - 97469 while RT4 genearted the least revenue of 309 million USD and had least number of guest - 33841.
 6. As concerns booking percentage/ room category, RT2 had the highest percentage of 37% while RT4 registered the least of 12%.
 7. Average rating registered is 4.
## Conclusions
Luxury hotels were preferred over business hotels by most customers and the elite standatd rooms awere most prefered over other room categories; with more revenue registered. There were more check outs that no shows and cancellation with check out generating over 1 billion USD. Actual losses were minimal compared to profits. 
## Recommendations
 Luxury and business hotels of other properties should be updated and proper advertising strategy should be implemented. Also, frequent users should be given discounts to encourage visits. Business class hotels should be properly advertised too. A survey should be conducted to know more about client preferences. Market share should be tabled and discussed then properly implemented.
 ## Lessons Learnt
 This project strenghtened my understanding of data story telling and dashboard designs for executive purposes. It also helped me optimize business impact communication and visuals.
 ## Tools Used.
 PowerBi and Excel.
